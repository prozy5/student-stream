  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Our mission is to give creators ownership, freedom, and real opportunities to grow —
        without relying on outdated platforms, unfair algorithms, or broken monetization systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe creators should control their content, their audience, and how they earn.
        StudentStream is built to provide the infrastructure that makes that possible.

      <h3>Deondre</h3>

      <p>
        Deondre is the owner and founder of the technology company StudentStream and the creator behind its
        first division, SS Films.
      </p>

      <p>
        He started StudentStream with the goal of building platforms that give creators real control over their
        content, revenue, and audience — without depending on traditional media companies or unfair systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as an idea to support independent creators has grown into a full platform focused on streaming,
        creator tools, and monetization infrastructure designed for the next generation of digital media.
      </p>

      <p style="opacity:.7;font-size:14px;margin-top:12px">
        “Creators deserve ownership, freedom, and systems that actually work for them. StudentStream is built to make that possible.”
