  <h1>Deondre</h1>
  <p>
    Owner & Founder of StudentStream — an independent technology company building creator-owned media platforms,
    production systems, and digital infrastructure.

    <span class="badge">Founder Story</span>

    <p>
      Deondre is the owner and founder of StudentStream, an independent technology company created to power creator-owned media platforms and digital infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      StudentStream was not built as a single website or streaming product. It was designed from the beginning as a technology company — focused on building systems that creators, filmmakers, and digital publishers could control rather than rent from large platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before founding StudentStream, most available platforms followed the same structure: creators provide the content, companies control the platform, and ownership is gradually lost. Deondre identified this imbalance as the core problem — not talent, not visibility, but control.
    </p>

    <p>
      StudentStream was created to solve that problem directly by building infrastructure instead of dependency.
    </p>

    <p>
      The company’s first public division, SS Films, serves as a real-world implementation of StudentStream’s technology stack — including creator verification, authentication systems, video storage, publishing pipelines, monetization architecture, and streaming delivery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than relying on third-party services or packaged platforms, Deondre built StudentStream’s foundation from the ground up, including databases, content management systems, onboarding workflows, and moderation tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, StudentStream operates as a long-term technology company focused on building stable, creator-controlled systems that remain functional regardless of platform trends, algorithm changes, or corporate policy shifts.

    <div class="letter">
      <p>
        StudentStream was never meant to be another platform competing for attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was built to change who controls the systems creators depend on.
      </p>

      <p>
        SS Films is only the first public division — a working demonstration of what creator-owned infrastructure can look like when it is designed intentionally and independently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The long-term vision is to build technology that outlives trends and gives creators permanent leverage over their work, their distribution, and their revenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        StudentStream exists to build that foundation.

    <p>
      StudentStream is being developed as a long-term infrastructure company.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission is to provide creators with the same technical power as major studios — without surrendering ownership, control, or independence.
