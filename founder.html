  <h1>Deondre</h1>
  <p>
    Owner & Founder of StudentStream — a technology company building independent platforms for creators, media,
    legal protection, production systems, and investigative storytelling.

  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge">Founder Story</span>

    <p>
      StudentStream was founded by Deondre with one core belief: creators should not have to depend on broken systems
      to succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The modern creator economy is filled with platforms that control visibility, revenue, and ownership — often
      leaving creators with little power over their own work. Instead of accepting that model, Deondre chose to build
      something different.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a vision for a fair streaming platform slowly evolved into a larger ecosystem: a company designed
      to give creators infrastructure, legal protection, production tools, and long-term control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than waiting for permission or funding, StudentStream was built step by step — from system design and
      platform architecture to creator onboarding and content infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      SS Films became the first division to launch, acting as proof that independent creators can publish, grow,
      and earn without giving up ownership of their work.

    <span class="badge">Letter from the Founder</span>

    <div class="letter">
      <p>
        StudentStream was never meant to be just another platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was built out of frustration with systems that take from creators while giving them little control in return.
        Platforms should empower the people who build them — not trap them inside contracts, algorithms, and unfair rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        SS Films represents the first step toward something larger: a future where creators publish freely, earn honestly,
        and keep ownership of what they build.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every division under StudentStream exists for the same reason — to give creators tools instead of obstacles,
        structure instead of confusion, and ownership instead of dependency.
      </p>

      <p>
        This company is still early. The systems are still growing. But the mission is permanent.
      </p>

    <span class="badge">Vision</span>

    <p>
      StudentStream is being built as long-term infrastructure — not just a collection of apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to create systems where creators can publish, protect, monetize, and scale without losing control
      over their work.
    </p>

    <p>
      SS Films is only the beginning.
