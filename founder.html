  <h1>Deondre</h1>
  <p>
    Owner & Founder of StudentStream — a multi-division technology company building
    infrastructure for independent creators, digital media, and investigative storytelling.

</section>

<section class="section">
  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge">Founder Story</span>

    <p>
      StudentStream was founded by Deondre as a technology company, not a single platform or media project.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original concept began with streaming, but quickly revealed a deeper problem: creators lacked
      ownership, protection, and systems designed for long-term independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of building another platform that extracted value from creators, StudentStream was structured
      as an ecosystem — combining distribution, production technology, legal infrastructure, and investigative media
      under one organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each division was designed to solve a specific failure in the modern creator economy:
    </p>

    <ul style="opacity:.9; line-height:1.7">
      <li><b>SS Films</b> — creator-owned streaming and monetization.</li>
      <li><b>StudentStream Studios</b> — production systems and platform technology.</li>
      <li><b>SSI Law</b> — legal protection, ownership frameworks, and digital rights.</li>
      <li><b>SS:I</b> — investigation of hidden systems, untold stories, and the unknown.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      StudentStream was built independently from the ground up — including its platform architecture,
      databases, creator tools, and content systems — with a long-term focus on scalability and creator ownership.
    </p>

    <p>
      The company’s mission is not to replace creators, but to provide the infrastructure they control.

    <span class="badge">Letter from the Founder</span>

    <div class="letter">
      <p>
        StudentStream exists because creators deserve more than platforms that profit from their work while
        offering little control in return.
      </p>

      <p>
        SS Films is only the beginning. Every division under this company was designed to give creators ownership,
        stability, and long-term leverage in a digital world that often removes all three.
      </p>

      <p>
        This company is being built with patience, intention, and systems that can last.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is simple: build infrastructure that creators can rely on.
      </p>

    <p>
      StudentStream is being built as a long-term technology company focused on creator-owned platforms,
      digital rights, and independent media systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The objective is not rapid hype, but durable infrastructure.
